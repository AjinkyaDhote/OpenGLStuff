Coordinate systems


OpenGL is a right handed system.

OPenGL expects all the vertices , that we want to be visible in normalized device coordinates. 
That is x, y and z coordinates of each vertex should be between -1.0 and 1.0. Coordinates outside this range will not be visible.

What we usually do is specify the coordinates in a range(or space) we determine ourselves and in the vertex shader,
transform these coordinates to normalized device coordinates (NDC). Than this NDC is given to the rasterizer to transform
them to 2D coordinates/pixels on your screen.

There are 5 different coordinate systems - 
Local Space (or Object Space)
World Space
View Space
Clip Space
Screen Space
